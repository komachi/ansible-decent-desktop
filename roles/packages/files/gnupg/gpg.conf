## When creating a key, individuals may designate a specific keyserver to use to pull their keys from.
## The above option will disregard this designation and use the pool, which is useful because (1) it
## prevents someone from designating an insecure method for pulling their key and (2) if the server
## designated uses hkps, the refresh will fail because the ca-cert will not match, so the keys will
## never be refreshed.
keyserver-options no-honor-keyserver-url

## when outputting certificates, view user IDs distinctly from keys:
fixed-list-mode

## long keyids are more collision-resistant than short keyids (it's trivial to make a key with any desired short keyid)
keyid-format 0xlong

## If you use a graphical environment (and even if you don't) you should be using an agent:
## (similar arguments as https://www.debian-administration.org/users/dkg/weblog/64)
use-agent

## You should always know at a glance which User IDs gpg thinks are legitimately bound to the keys in your keyring:
verify-options show-uid-validity
list-options show-uid-validity

## include an unambiguous indicator of which key made a signature:
## (see http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.mail.notmuch.general/3721/focus=7234)
sig-notation issuer-fpr@notations.openpgp.fifthhorseman.net=%g
